# FFUF Starter - Angular + Tailwind (Standalone components)

## What's included
- Angular standalone component-based one-page site
- TailwindCSS configured (postcss, tailwind config included)
- Warm-toned theme suitable for a foundation

## How to use
1. Unzip the project.
2. In the project folder run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
   (This uses Angular CLI from devDependencies. If you prefer global CLI, install `@angular/cli` globally.)

3. Replace placeholder images in `src/assets/` or edit content in `src/app/app.component.html`.

## Notes
- This starter focuses on structure and styling. For production builds, review Angular & Tailwind versions, and integrate any backend or CMS you prefer.
- If you want separate components per section (instead of a single file), I can split them into modular standalone components next.

Enjoy â€” and tell me if you want me to split sections into separate components or add a contact form with Netlify/Firebase integration.
